        <h1 class="web-title">Me as an Audio Engineer</h1>
        <p class="web-description">
                Hi, I'm an Audio Engineer & Musical Producer. Specialized in Acoustic music and recording engineering.
                <br><br>My passion for music started when I was 15 years old. That was the time I bought my first guitar. 
                As years passed, I was convinced I wanted to do something related to music. Being in a stage is one of the 
                greatest feelings someone could ever have. Despite that, I fell in love with the Recording Studio, all the 
                experimentation that happens in there.. is simply AMAZING. I remember what I felt the first time I entered a 
                recording studio, in that exact moment, I knew what I wanted to be.<br><br>
                All my work in this area is focused in that moment... 
        </p>
